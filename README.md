# Files

The goal of `Files` is to do basic file operations via the `Command Palette`.  
My goal for the first Version is to have:

- [x] Create Files
- [x] Create Folders
- [x] Rename Files/Folders
- [ ] Delete Files/Folders
- [ ] Check for an implementation of creating files with templates.

## Commands:
- Files: Create File
- Files: Create Folder
- Files: Rename
